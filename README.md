Prediction of susceptibility to future Stress using features of sleep disturbances prior to exposure to chronic social stress
ABSTRACT
There is a tight association between mood and sleep as disrupted sleep is a core feature of many mood disorders. 
There is a paucity in available animal models for investigating the role of sleep in the etiopathogenesis of depression. 
Therefore, we aimed to assess whether prior sleep disturbances can predict susceptibility to future stress using the chronic social defeat (CSD) stress paradigm. 
Pre-CSD, mice susceptible to stress displayed increased fragmentation of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep, due to increased switching between NREM and wake and a higher percentage of NREM bouts with short duration, relative to resilient mice. The pre-CSD sleep features from both phenotypes were separable enough to allow prediction of susceptibility to stress with around 80% accuracy. Post-CSD, susceptible mice maintained the enhanced NREM fragmentation while resilient mice exhibited high NREM fragmentation, only in the dark. Our findings emphasized the putative role sleep plays in signaling vulnerability to stress.


Data Struture
After scoring the vigilance states of 7 Susceptible and 7 Resilient mice pre-exposure to chronic stress, 30 sleep features were extracted prior to exposure to stress:
Number of NREM bouts during the light
Number of NREM bouts during the dark
NREM bouts duration during the light
NREM bouts duration during the dark
NREM-to-REM-Transitions during the light
Wake-to-NREM-Transitions during the light
NREM-to-wake-Transitions during the light
REM-to-wake-Transitions during the light
NREM-to-REM-Transitions during the dark
Wake-to-NREM-Transitions during the dark
NREM-to-wake-Transitions during the dark
REM-to-wake-Transitions during the dark
Wake latency during the light
NREM latency during the light
REM latency during the light
Wake latency during the dark
NREM latency during the dark
REM latency during the dark
Inter-Wake-Interval during the light
Inter-NREM-Interval during the light
Inter-REM-Interval during the light
Inter-Wake-Interval during the dark
Inter-NREM-Interval during the dark
Inter-REM-Interval during the dark
Percent time in wake during the light
Percent time in NREM during the light
Percent time in REM during the light
Percent time in wake during the light
Percent time in NREM during the light
Percent time in REM during the light
It is worth mentioning that C57/B6J mice display a fragmented sleep pattern: they sleep in bouts, they spend 60-70% of the time during the light cycle in sleep state versus 30-40% in the dark cycle as they are nocturnal and more active during the dark. In rodents, such as mice and rats, sleep is made of two states: NREM and REM sleep.
