# PredictiveModel_vulnerability_sleepEEG


Question/Science Problem
Can we use pre-stress sleep features to predict vulnerability to stress? Can sleep disturbances, prior to stress exposure, be predictors to future stress susceptibility and poor psychiatric outcomes?


Here, we deployed Logistic Regression/SVC models + Feature Engineering to deal with Multicolinearity to answer this question


ABSTRACT
There is a tight association between mood and sleep as disrupted sleep is a core feature of many mood disorders. 
There is a paucity in available animal models for investigating the role of sleep in the etiopathogenesis of depression. 
Therefore, we aimed to assess whether prior sleep disturbances can predict susceptibility to future stress using the chronic social defeat (CSD) stress paradigm. 
Pre-CSD, mice susceptible to stress displayed increased fragmentation of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep, due to increased switching between NREM and wake and a higher percentage of NREM bouts with short duration, relative to resilient mice. The pre-CSD sleep features from both phenotypes were separable enough to allow prediction of susceptibility to stress with around 80% accuracy. Post-CSD, susceptible mice maintained the enhanced NREM fragmentation while resilient mice exhibited high NREM fragmentation, only in the dark. Our findings emphasized the putative role sleep plays in signaling vulnerability to stress.


Sleep Features extracted from EEG
After scoring the vigilance states of 7 Susceptible and 7 Resilient mice pre-exposure to chronic stress, 30 sleep features were extracted prior to exposure to stress:
1. Number of NREM bouts during the light
2. Number of NREM bouts during the dark
3. NREM bouts duration during the light
4. NREM bouts duration during the dark
5. NREM-to-REM-Transitions during the light
6. Wake-to-NREM-Transitions during the light
7. NREM-to-wake-Transitions during the light
8. REM-to-wake-Transitions during the light
9. NREM-to-REM-Transitions during the dark
10. Wake-to-NREM-Transitions during the dark
11. NREM-to-wake-Transitions during the dark
12. REM-to-wake-Transitions during the dark
13. Wake latency during the light
14. NREM latency during the light
15. REM latency during the light
16. Wake latency during the dark
17. NREM latency during the dark
18. REM latency during the dark
19. Inter-Wake-Interval during the light
20. Inter-NREM-Interval during the light
21. Inter-REM-Interval during the light
22. Inter-Wake-Interval during the dark
23. Inter-NREM-Interval during the dark
24. Inter-REM-Interval during the dark
25. Percent time in wake during the light
26. Percent time in NREM during the light
27. Percent time in REM during the light
28. Percent time in wake during the light
29. Percent time in NREM during the light
30. Percent time in REM during the light

It is worth mentioning that C57/B6J mice display a fragmented sleep pattern: they sleep in bouts, they spend 60-70% of the time during the light cycle in sleep state versus 30-40% in the dark cycle as they are nocturnal and more active during the dark. In rodents, such as mice and rats, sleep is made of two states: NREM and REM sleep.
